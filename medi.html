                The East India Company’s increasing control over trade led to its dominance over Indian territories.
 This period marked the colonization of India and the gradual erosion of indigenous governance structures.</p>
 <p>The Indian National Movement was a pivotal period in India’s history marked by a determined struggle for independence 
 from British colonial rule.</p><p>Spanning the late 19th century to 1947, 
 The movement’s culmination in 1947 led to the end of British colonialism, granting India its hard-fought freedom and 
 shaping its trajectory as a sovereign nation committed to democracy and social justice.
 The watershed moment of India’s history saw the nation gain independence from colonial rule. However,
  the partition of India and Pakistan led to a tragic displacement of people and communal violence.</p>
